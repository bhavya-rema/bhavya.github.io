## Projects
### Recommendation model -Ecommerce
Inspired from https://www.amazon.science/publications/p-companion-a-principled-framework-for-diversified-complementary-product-recommendation)

Developed objective strategy for discovering frequently bought together items using **Python**, **Graph database-Neo4j** and **Neural netowork training**. The proposed method uses graph node embeddings(product embeddings) to train a neural network to output 3 recommendations for a product from exising customer purchase data.

### Opinion mining and sentiment analysis
Using POS-Tagging, created a parser for Hotel reviews To get Aspect opinion pairs and apply sentiment analysis on top. Approach will be to find specific aspects of the hotels(Example aspects could be Room servvice, Food, ambience, view etc.) in the customer reviews and the sentiments associated with those aspects. Here I am avoiding sentence level sentiment mining as there could be multiple sentiments in a single review.

### Retail Product Detection
Finetuning a Yolo v5 model with local dataset to improve accuracy of the object detection model for retail products on shelves. To further improve the accuracy between multipack and single pack products ensembling multiple detector models to create one powerful product detection with an mAP of 95% View the project details here https://github.com/bhavya-rema/Retail-product-detection/tree/main
